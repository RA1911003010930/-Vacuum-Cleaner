# -Vacuum-Cleaner
Vacuum cleaner problem is a well-known search problem for an agent which works on Artificial Intelligence. In this problem, our vacuum cleaner is our agent. It is a goal-based agent, and the goal of this agent, which is the vacuum cleaner, is to clean up the whole area. So, in the classical vacuum cleaner problem, we have two rooms and one vacuum cleaner. There is dirt in both the rooms and it is to be cleaned. The vacuum cleaner is present in any one of these rooms. So, we have to reach a state in which both the rooms are clean and are dust free.
Initially, the room is full of dirt and the vacuum cleaner can reside in any room. And to reach the final goal state, both the room should be clean and the vacuum cleaner again can reside in theroom.

The vacuum cleaner can perform the following functions: move left, move right, move forward,move backward and to suck dust. But as there are only two rooms in our problem, the vacuum cleaner performs only the following functions here: move left, move right and suck.
